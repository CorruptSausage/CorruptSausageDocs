                Phasmophobia is an investigative horror game developed and published by British indie game studio,
                Kinetic Games. The game became available in early access through Steam for Microsoft Windows with
                virtual reality support in September 2020. The game received a large influx of popularity the following
                month due to many well-known Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing it, mainly for the Halloween
                season.[1] As of October 15, 2020, the game was the sixth-most popular game on Twitch.[2] It was the
                best selling game on Steam globally for several weeks in October to November 2020
